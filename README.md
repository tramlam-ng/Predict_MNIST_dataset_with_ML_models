# Predict_MNIST_dataset_with_ML_models

_ This is a small project to use Machine Learning with an attempt to predict the classic MNIST dataset with the high accuracy possible. Several ML models were tried and the most promising ML model was chosen for fine-tuning.

- The most outstanding takeaway from this notebook is the application of PCA to deal with the curse of dimensionality.
